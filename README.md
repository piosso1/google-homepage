My first coding project was to clone google page and I started by linking my index.html page to google font site, I also link my html page to my style.css page.
After that I created the header comment on html page /* header */ which include in it, navbar heading and it classes.
Then I created the main body <!--Main Body Starts--> which include in it, google logo links & font and search botton.
Finally i created the footer <!--Bottom footer starts--> which is the bottom page part of the page.
